Some useful Stata programs developed by the author. Some of these programs are available at SSC. In Stata, type: ssc describe *programname*.

## Installtion:
Type the following within Stata and follow the instructions:

- medsurv: Calculate the median survival time from Cox/Poisson regression
```stata
